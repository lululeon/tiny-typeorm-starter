# Tiny Typeorm Starter

A very tiny baseline from which to stand up a nodejs / postgres / typeORM / express backend.

1. Run `npm i` command
1. Setup database settings inside `.env` file
1. Run `npm run up` command if you don't have postgres and want to kick off a tiny dockerized instance
1. Run one of the following:
    - `npm run dev` to run in developer mode with nodemon
    - `npm run test` to run the test suite
    - `npm start` to start the server.

How it evolves is up to you! Happy tinkering.
